# Havira

The idea behind the project was to explore clean architecture principles in android environment. Technologies used: Dagger hilt, Room, Navigation component.

Havira has 3 main functionalities:

-shopping list - products can be added manually or by selecting the recipe that you want to make. 
Missing ingredients will be added to the list. When you finish shopping checked products are added to your owned items.

-recipes - adding your recipes in the app has many benefits. 
You can filter them by your own categories, rating, cooking time or by how many ingedients you are missing (if any), making decision process of what to cook much easier. 
When you cook something you can substract used ingrediends from stored products using just one button.

-stored products - you can insert all available products into the app. 
It helps you to track your kitchen stock and works well with the recipies.  


Disclaimer: Project still in aplha version. There is much more functionality to be added soon.
